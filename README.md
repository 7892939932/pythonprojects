🕒 Tkinter Stopwatch App
A simple and elegant stopwatch application built using Python's Tkinter library. This GUI-based tool allows users to start, pause, reset, and quit a timer with real-time updates in HH:MM:SS format.

📦 Features
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Real-time time tracking
- Clean and intuitive GUI
- Built entirely with Python and Tkinter (no external libraries)

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
Installation
Clone the repository and run the script:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tkinter-stopwatch.git
cd tkinter-stopwatch
python stopwatch.py



🧠 How It Works
- The app uses after() to update the time every second.
- Time is tracked using global variables for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Buttons are linked to functions:
- start() begins the timer
- pause() stops the timer
- reset() sets the time back to 00:00:00
- quit() closes the application
